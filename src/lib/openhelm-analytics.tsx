/**
 * OpenHelm Analytics — this product's Google Analytics 4 measurement.
 *
 * ⚠️ GENERATED. The canonical copy is
 * `ProductFactory/_services/openhelm-analytics/openhelm-analytics.tsx`; edit it
 * there and re-run `node _services/openhelm-analytics/install.mjs` rather than
 * editing this file in a product. One implementation across every product is
 * the point: a per-product hand-pasted gtag snippet is how consent handling,
 * SPA page views and event naming drift apart across a portfolio.
 *
 * THE MEASUREMENT ID IS CONFIGURATION, NOT CODE. It is read from
 * `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` and never hardcoded. That is deliberate and
 * load-bearing: a GA4 property's id changes whenever the property is recreated
 * or moved between accounts, and a portfolio that hardcodes it needs 32 commits
 * and 32 deploys to re-point. With the id in the environment, re-pointing a
 * product at a different property is a Vercel env change and a redeploy.
 *
 * UNSET MEANS OFF, LOUDLY-IN-DEV AND SILENTLY-IN-PROD. With no measurement id
 * this renders nothing, loads no script, and `track()` is a no-op. It never
 * queues events for a tag that will never arrive and never pretends to have
 * measured anything. In development it says so once on the console, because a
 * product that thinks it is measuring and is not is the failure this whole
 * service exists to prevent.
 *
 * WHY NOT `@next/third-parties`. That package would be a dependency in 32
 * repositories to save ~30 lines, and it does not solve the part that is
 * actually easy to get wrong (below). A generated file keeps the dependency
 * count at zero and the behaviour identical everywhere.
 *
 * THE PART THAT IS EASY TO GET WRONG. gtag.js sends one `page_view` when it
 * loads. The App Router then navigates on the client without a document load,
 * so every route after the first is invisible unless the app sends the event
 * itself — the single most common way a Next.js site reports a tenth of its
 * real traffic. So `send_page_view` is switched OFF at config time and every
 * view, including the first, is sent explicitly on pathname/query change.
 *
 * WHY THE SUSPENSE BOUNDARY IS NOT OPTIONAL. `useSearchParams()` in a component
 * that is not inside `<Suspense>` opts the WHOLE route out of static rendering
 * (Next.js bails to client-side rendering at build time). Analytics must never
 * change how a product's pages render, so the hook-using half is isolated
 * behind a boundary here rather than left for each product to remember.
 *
 * NON-WEB SURFACES. A desktop (Tauri/Electron) or mobile (Expo/React Native)
 * build has no `document` to put a tag in. Those send through the Measurement
 * Protocol instead — see `openhelm-analytics-mp.ts` beside this file, which
 * reports to the SAME GA4 property through its own data stream. Do not try to
 * load gtag.js in a native shell.
